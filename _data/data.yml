      To be able to better handle and prepare for the expansion of the company, we needed to

      In my new role as Product Manager for the internal cloud of IST, I continued the development
      of the platform itself but focused mainly on creating a reliable, transparent and uncomplicated
      experience for the developers themselves. To aid the developers, we created an ecosystem and
      community where developers could share best practices and lessons learned while having
      direct contact with the engineers of the cloud.

    details: |
      To be able to build the next generation of school software IST needed a solid foundation.
      As Architect Manager, I helped by steering technology choices and improving the developer
      experience as well as speed and reliability. Some changes included switching to GIT to
      better allow for parallel development. The running of software switched to Docker from
      traditional hands-on operations, including automatic service discovery, load-balancing
      and auto-healing capabilities among other features. All of these changes meant a more
      reliable platform, shorter time to production and less error-prone.
      The platform became a huge success factor for IST.
