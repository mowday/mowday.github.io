  summary: |
    I’m a highly result-driven individual with great analytical skills that feed on finding 
    solutions. The harder the situation the more rewarding it is to finally find the solution
    that will hold.

    My ability to unite people towards a common goal and vision is one of my key strengths

    comfort zone and seeing what we could do if we reached just a little bit farther, letting
    passion and curiosity move us forward.
